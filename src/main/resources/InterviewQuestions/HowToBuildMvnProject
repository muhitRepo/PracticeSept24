Q1. How to Build a Maven project? (Basic)

	Step 1: 

	File--> New--> Other--> Maven Project --> next--> Create simple project --> 
	Use default location --> GroupId--Artifact  ID --> Finish
	
	Step2: 

	Update properties file if needed in POM.XML file with (Apache Mavn compiler properties (https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/examples/set-compiler-source-and-target.html))
	--> paste the properties after </version> in pom.xml file
	Update the Java version # installed in your machine. 
	
	Mac: java --version

	<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
 	</properties>
 
 	Step 3: 
 
 	Force Update Maven Project: Right on Project name --> Maven--> UpdateProject--> Forced update releases. 
 	
 Q2. What is Pom.xml file? 
 	 Ans: It is configuration file for the project. 
 	 
 	 Optional info (All the codes or dependencies or libraries we write in pom.xml file they gets downloaded in the machine from Maven repository. 
 	 That's basically line #1 in pom.xml file.  All dependencies gets downloaded in .m2 files)
 	
 Q3. What is Artifact ID? == It is the Project name (Most IMP)
 	 Your compiler or whole java system knows this by this "ProjectName" 
 	
 Q4. What is the GroupID? == Is a Package name 
 
 Q5. How to Update Java of the Maven project? 
 
 	 Need this Apache Maven properties file and save and update with right JAVA version in the system. 
 	  
 		<properties>
    		<maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    		<maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
 		</properties>
 
 Q6. How Do I know which java version I have in system? 
 
		For Mac Terminal > type:  (java --version) AND see what version is installed in the system.  
 		Windows: go to system properties > Env variables > Path
 		Or See in the source folder where it is installed. 
 		
 		If you have latest version e.g (java 20) in your system, the older version like 17, 14, 8 is covered. 
 		But if you call for more latest version it will not work, coz the info is not in the machine.
